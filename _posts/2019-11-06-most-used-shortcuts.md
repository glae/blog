I have been using JetBrains' [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (Community edition) since 2012. A colleague showed us this IDE and its amazing refactoring features and stability. At the time, most of us were using [Eclipse](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/). I kept using both Eclipse and IntelliJ during months, then I switched solely to IntelliJ (I guess I ragequited Eclipse after a maven or SVN plugin crash). 

Afterwards I had the opportunity to use and enjoy the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate version, which contains the very nice SQL client [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) for instance. I also used Android Studio and AppCode which are the dedicated versions for native-mobile development. 

## The absolute `shift+shift`

This one is the God one. The meta one. It's like the Windows or Command key on the operating system. It can find everything : actions (`ctrl+shift+A`), class (`ctrl+N`), files (`Ctrl+shift+N`), symbols.

It is almost the only one shortcut to know and to pretend to be a senior all-inclusive stack developer. Tons of hours saved, that can be then wasted on Twitter or Reddit. 

## Refactoring 

### Rename: `shift+F6`

The basic "rename". Works for everything. Sometimes gives some useful suggestions.

### Refactor all the things! `ctrl+alt+whatever`

To introduce a `c`onstant, use `ctrl+alt+C`, to introduce a `v`ariable, use `ctrl+alt+V` :

To extract a `m`ethod, use `ctrl+alt+M`. A `p`arameter, `ctrl+alt+P`.
