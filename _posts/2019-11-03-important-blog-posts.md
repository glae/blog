# {{page.title}}

I have been reading many websites including blogs to increase 
my software culture, trying to open my mind (a tough job). I picked some blog posts that have deeply 
influenced me and/or changed my mindset. I excluded the ones in french, my native tongue.

They are grouped by themes:

## How to cook code 

> Bob: I like compiled languages because the compiler will check many of the possible errors for me, instead of runtime crash!
>
> Alice: That's interesting, but let me see your code... All your function parameters are typed `string` or `boolean`, are you so sure about this?

- Alice is right: [https://codemonkeyism.com/never-never-never-use-string-in-java-or-at-least-less-often/](https://codemonkeyism.com/never-never-never-use-string-in-java-or-at-least-less-often/)
- Robert C. Martin is a reference (I did not say "Guru") in software design, and points out many software design issues, one of the most important, **naming**: [https://medium.com/ltunes/what-is-clean-code-naming-conventions-part-1-426d383eb85d](https://medium.com/ltunes/what-is-clean-code-naming-conventions-part-1-426d383eb85d)
- We live in a API world, however, they have different purposes and natures : [https://teks.co.in/site/blog/external-apis-vs-internal-apis-know-the-differences/](https://teks.co.in/site/blog/external-apis-vs-internal-apis-know-the-differences/)
- Testing is a requirement in software industry, it can have several shapes and antipatterns: [https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/introducing-software-testing-cupcake-anti-pattern](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/introducing-software-testing-cupcake-anti-pattern)

## How to work in a team

- I used to work in companies where developers did not read or work or each other's code, you can imagine the atmosphere when the production platform crashed: [https://dzone.com/articles/4-types-of-code-reviews-any-professional-developer](https://dzone.com/articles/4-types-of-code-reviews-any-professional-developer)
- Working with a version control system can be tricky, particularly when it's a decentralized one. This flow, known as a git-flow, should help your team working together: [https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
- I often hear some colleagues saying "Agile sucks, Waterfall is more straightforward": [http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2015/10/16/Agile-And-Waterfall.html](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2015/10/16/Agile-And-Waterfall.html)


## Computer legacy and general knowledge

- A long but interesting complaint about wasting resources: [https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/](https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/)
- Our computer world is based on many specifications (RFC, W3C, ISO...), skin-deep knowledge can lead to misinterpretation: [https://haacked.com/archive/2007/08/21/i-knew-how-to-validate-an-email-address-until-i.aspx/](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/08/21/i-knew-how-to-validate-an-email-address-until-i.aspx/)
- Ever heard of `null`? That should be worth a try: [https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2015/08/31/the-worst-mistake-of-computer-science/](https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2015/08/31/the-worst-mistake-of-computer-science/)


## DDD 

- I got more and more interested in [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), this blog post is kind of twisted introduction to it: [https://medium.com/swlh/acronyms-are-making-you-dumb-682e7fd52c86](https://medium.com/swlh/acronyms-are-making-you-dumb-682e7fd52c86)
