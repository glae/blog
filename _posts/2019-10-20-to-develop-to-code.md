## "You code all day long"

I have mixed feelings about programming languages. Non-IT or non-developer people tend towards thinking a dev job is **all about programming**. And that programming language `X` is better than `Y` for `R1` or `R2` reason (or `FA` or `FB` framework). In my own experience, they are mostly wrong. My job includes, in a non-exhaustive fashion, several different actions: 
- to communicate: about everything (feature, bug, infrastructure, UI, UX, design) with everyone (product owner, manager, dev, architect, designer, ops) with every tool (real contact, phone, chat, email, document) 
- to design: a system, an architecture, an API, some interactions (usually it requires some people standing in front of a whiteboard)
- to implement: development (in `X` or `Y` language), testing, deployment, configuration, review
- to "bureaucrate", e.g.: budget/holidays reporting for management, JIRA/Trello/Aptana/board updates, ticket to ask for a new database

## From a wider sight

I see the same conflation in the french public education, our (so-called) specialists say:
> Kids should learn at school coding/how to program.

I am confused. I think kids should really see the whole picture and grow a digital culture, by learning and understanding our digital world in its countless fields: privacy, security, cloud, GAFAM, banking, internet, networks, social media...

For those who say:
> These bunch of developers, they just have ["to shit code"](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/7c/7c0cc2ef5055864b867487205e7e8b08f0776077fd1570149809119163a4a15a.jpg).

I would moderate this previous statement: they communicate, design, implement and bureaucrate.

As a developer, I try to change people's minds about this perception of a "task performer" and promote developers' more diverse skills set.
