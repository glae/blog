## Cooptation exists in most of IT companies

I work in a IT services company ("ESN" or "SSII", e.g.: Capgemini, IBM, Atos, Orange Business Services, HP, Sopra Steria...). I spend 99% of my time doing developer missions in one of our customer's premises.

In most of these companies, human resources people promote cooptation: they regularly ask you to find new employees/developers/talents/meat balls/engineers/talents to help the company to grow.

## Money raises suspicion

I cannot stop thinking:

- are you really recommending someone to help your company grow? 
- are you shamelessly recommending someone to get a bonus, no matter what the people you recommend be worth? 
- does your company need to distribute bonuses to help recruiting? Isn't supposed to be attractive without these artificial tricks?

I guess I might be (too?) idealistic, I need to leave money out to believe in a true sincere recommendation for a job.
