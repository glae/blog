*This post is a genuine random software developer thought.*

I work in a IT services company ("ESN" or "SSII", e.g.: Capgemini, IBM, Atos, Orange Business Services, HP, Sopra Steria...). I spend 99% of my time doing developer missions in one of our customer's premises.

In most of these companies, human resources people promote cooptation: they regularly ask you to find new employees/developers/talents/meat balls/engineers/talents to help the company to grow.

When you persuade someone to join your company, that's fine, you can help someone to get a job. However, I think things are going messy when your employer give you some money rewarding a new recruitement. 

I cannot stop thinking:

- are you really recommending someone to help your company grow? 
- are you shamelessly recommending someone to get a bonus, no matter what the people you recommend be worth? 
- does your company need to distribute bonuses to help recruiting? Isn't supposed to be attractive without these artificial tricks?

I guess I might be (too?) idealistic, I need to leave money out to believe in a true sincere recommendation for a job.
