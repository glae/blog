*This post is a genuine random software developer thought.*

## Cooptation exists in most of IT companies

I work in an [IT services company](https://www.apside.com/en/) (In french, "ESN" or "SSII", e.g.: Capgemini, IBM, Atos, Orange Business Services, HP, Sopra Steria...). I spend 99% of my time doing developer missions in one of our customer's premises.

In most of these companies, human resources people promote cooptation: they regularly ask you to find new employees/developers/meat balls/engineers/talents to help the company to grow (and make more :moneybag: :moneybag: :moneybag:).

## [Definition time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otCpCn0l4Wo)! 

Acccording to [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cooptation), a "cooptation" (others forms/synonyms : coöptation (`ö`... really? [Guess what!](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_terms_spelled_with_%C3%96)), co-optation, co-opting, co-option) is:
> A co-opting: an absorption or assimilation
> [...]
> From Latin cooptō (“to choose, elect”).

According to [WordReference](https://www.wordreference.com/definition/cooptation), it's a close definition: 
> to assimilate, take, or win over into a larger or established group

## Money raises suspicion  

When you persuade someone to join your company, that's fine, you can help someone to get a job. However, I think things are going messy when your employer gives you some money rewarding a new recruitement. 

I cannot stop thinking:

- are you really recommending someone to help your company grow? 
- are you shamelessly recommending someone to get a bonus, no matter what the people you recommend be worth? 
- does your company need to distribute bonuses to help recruiting? Isn't it supposed to be appealing without these artificial tricks?

I guess I might be (too?) idealistic, I need to leave money out to believe in a true sincere recommendation for a job, or anything in general.
