# My dream ASCII company :page_with_curl:
###### Published on 2019-10-16.

I wish I work in a company that use [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) or plain text as a primary format for its written work. 

## Why ?

There are many reasons why, but here's for me the three main ones:
1. beauty: people working in IT mostly **do** suck at making pretty content or documents, so plain text avoid trying to do so
1. simplicity: splitting the form and substance (or the style and content) keeps things simpler (e.g. [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle))
1. money: ASCII is just free! 

Here is my personal experience with all of these. 

### 1999 - Fucking plain text

I started writing my diary in 1999. It was all plain text ending with `.txt`. It's still readable: 
```
Let's have a fun in my castle
To see the sunshine people
```
On my computer at the time, there was a weird 30KB max size limit.  

### 2006 - Latex + Beamer

In computer science degree, I had to write another thesis. I was used to use Word or OpenOffice for this kind of stuff, but a classmate introduce me to this fucked-up-case-document-system called [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) (pronunciation under debate as in GIF or [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/what-is-mysql.html)).

I immediately felt in love with it (well, until I had to include figures in my document), here is an example: 
```latex
\chapter{Schedulability}

	The development of an embedded real-time application supposes that it needs to be 
    scheduled. First, we know that scheduling is based on three components:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] an algorithm for allocating the resources \emph{(scheduling mechanism)}
		\item[-] an algorithm for ordering access to resources \emph{(scheduling policy)}
		\item[-] a means of predicting the worst-case behavior of the system when the 
        policy and mechanism are applied \emph{(schedulability analysis)}
	\end{itemize}

\section{Assessment}

\subsection{Scheduling mechanism}

We will use the Fixed Priority Scheduling (FPS) mechanism in a preemptive scheme for 
this purpose, a common way to schedule real-time systems. A static-priority algorithm 
assigns all priorities at design time, and those priorities remain constants for 
the lifetime of the task : we are in this case~\cite{LiuLay73}. 
```

### 2008 - Wikis

### 2011 - Markdown + AsciiDoc

diff (unix tools) on the french law !
look at github : every decent has its README.md or README.adoc 

### 2013 - Diagrams fantasy

plantuml, plain text 



## Excel, Word, Powerpoint, LibreOffice disturb you from what's important

# Tech skills: necessary but not sufficient :no_mouth:
###### Published on [2019-08-29](https://xkcd.com/1179/).

I often see this [learning roadmap link](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap). It is a nice start for anyone who wants to learn or to improve its development skills. 

However, [as someone mentioned this issue](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/issues/40), we lack of some social skills developer roadmap. All these really nice tech skills are useless without the ability to promote and argue about your technical choices and approaches.
